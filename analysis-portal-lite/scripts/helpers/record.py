"""
Record assembly for the JSONBin index + detail architecture.
=============================================================

Pure functions. No network, no environment variables, no side effects — so this
module is fully testable offline. Transport lives in `jsonbin.py`.

Produces two artefacts per completed analysis job:

  build_detail_record(...)  → the per-run detail bin body (schema 2)
  build_index_entry(...)    → the lightweight entry appended to the index bin

Content tiers (design doc §3.4, fork F):
  Tier 1 — `summary`  : caller-supplied summary scalars from the results dict
  Tier 3 — `sidecars` : full plot data for every panel
  Tier 2 (Excel data tables) is deliberately omitted as redundant against tier 3.

# Sidecars are stored compressed. JSONBin's reverse proxy (nginx) rejects
# request bodies over roughly 1 MB with a 413 — a limit well below the

# around 6.5x raw, ~4.9x after base64 framing, which brings all but pathological
# runs comfortably under the cap.
#
# Everything a human would inspect in the JSONBin dashboard — metrics, summary,
# conditions — stays plain JSON. Only the machine-only sidecar block is opaque.
